            Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great truths,
            however I believe Buddhists have lost the way of the Buddha and lack
            a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism is a solution to those
            who seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha Wanted. If Buddha was
            alive today, imagine the amount of change and impact he would be
            having.
