          As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential people in
          the world today are not Buddhists. On top of that anyone from a
          Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not heard from a
          Buddhist about why that path is best.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the first
          vow, and try to move on to 2,3, and 4. By the very means of the vows,
          step 2 cannot be done without first completing step 1. Step 1 is in
          fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a harmonious right of
          passage that must be balanced in action towards their completion.
        </p>

          Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly
          desires IN ORDER TO save all people, and to learn all teachings IN
          ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are completed
          perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these tasks
          are in harmony. As one renounces more wordy desires to spend more time
          saving people, one learns teachings to improve how they go about
          saving others, and rides the collective path towards enlightenment.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, instead of following this path and order, Buddhists today are
          known as people continually meditating. Struggling to awaken and
          renounce all worldly desires, and instead all acting to each other
          like they are farther along the path. I believe Buddhism has become a
          sick game of ineffective spiritual ego stroking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not saying that the Men and Women who have become great at
          meditating for hours and wholly living a minimalist life have not gone
          further down their path of enlightenment, instead that it is very sad
          that so much potential is moving towards the wrong place for the world
          to awaken and be saved. It is a fact these people who realize their
          potential to follow the first vow will be some of the strongest
          Buddhas there are.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The funny thing about tech entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing the
          future, and Buddhism is that these tech entrepreneurs are slowly
          learning the way of the Buddha in order to optimize themselves. They
          are reaching new paths of enlightenment. Instead of referring to their
          actions as the Buddha way, they are learning the teachings of Buddha
          in order to be more effective.{" "}
