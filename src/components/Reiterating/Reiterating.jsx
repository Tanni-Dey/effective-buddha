              <p>
                Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment
                rather than practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an
                enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide,
                preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions
                live on to this day.

                Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply
                meditate. The idea is to relinquish attachment to earthly
                desires in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do
                nothing. In an effort of learning all teachings, we will
                re-evaluate the core values, and give a new perspective based on
                the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that
                Nirvana is something to achieve in this realm. And that leaving
                this realm is a negative desire in it of itself.

              1. To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is
              failed to be recognized by modern Buddhist society. Outreach is a
              non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information are
              left in the dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress
              using technology (tools to increase impact) are completely
              disregarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to
              renounce. But here’s what the true text says “**Desires** for
              tangible things (such as wealth, property, or other material
              goods) or for pleasures of the body (such as sexual activity,
              gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits). Buddhism teaches us to
              try to let go of our **worldly desires**, freeing our minds and
              bodies for a state of enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds
              and bodies for a state of enlightenment.

              3. Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not
              even know how consciousness works yet. To learn all teachings, we
              need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing to
              learn at this time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.

              4. “In **Buddhism**, **enlightenment** (called bodhi in Indian
              **Buddhism**, or satori in Zen **Buddhism**) is when a
              **Buddhist** finds the truth about life and stops being reborn
              because they have reached Nirvana.” In order to stop the cycle of
              rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle. With infinite time
              our particles are always brought back to a conscious form. Until
              we find a conscious form to reach Nirvana in, we will repeat the
              cycle.
